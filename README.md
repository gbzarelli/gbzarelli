<h1>Hi there üëã</h1>

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in software development and technical leadership, working on strategic projects for large-scale companies in the technology sector. With over a decade of expertise, I began my career as a Java developer in 2011, focusing on mobile development with **J2ME** and maintaining back-end applications. My professional growth led me to **Android** development and eventually to a senior developer role, mastering technologies like **Java, Kotlin**, and modern architectures.

Throughout my journey, I have had the opportunity to lead teams and influence strategic decisions, with key highlights including:

- **Technical Leadership**: As Tech Lead in the logistics vertical at Magazine Luiza, supporting squads in defining architectures, establishing patterns, and creating solutions that simplify development. Additionally, I contributed to complex cloud migration processes, including transitions between AWS, GCP, and MagaluCloud.
- **Development and Automation**: As a Back-End developer, I built and maintained critical systems, focusing on the automation and modernization of legacy systems, directly improving customer experience and operational efficiency.
- **Infrastructure Optimization**: Participated in cost-reduction and performance optimization projects, aligning infrastructure with sustainable business growth.

Currently, as a **Staff Software Engineer** in the Corporate Financial Services unit at **PicPay**, I hold a strategic and technical role, leading **architectural decisions** and **driving scalable**, **resilient solutions**. With a focus on transaction capture in the Acquiring sector, I leverage technologies like **Spring Boot, RabbitMQ, Docker, AWS, etc**, combined with observability tools like **Grafana** and **Prometheus**, to ensure **high performance and stability**.

Beyond technical development, **I am committed to knowledge sharing by creating presentations and disseminating best practices**, fostering consistency and excellence in team deliveries.

I am **always seeking challenges** that allow me to grow professionally and contribute to the success of the projects I engage with.
